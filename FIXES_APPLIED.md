# Canvas and Backend Connection - Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed the Canvas component not rendering and prepared the system for backend connectivity. All changes have been successfully applied and linter errors resolved.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Canvas Component Not Being Rendered ✅
**Problem**: `App.tsx` had a test div implementation instead of using the proper Canvas component.

**Fix**:
- Added import: `import { Canvas } from './components/Canvas';`
- Replaced test div (lines 315-360) with proper Canvas component implementation
- Removed debug console logs and test button
- Canvas now properly receives all required props: entities, relationships, zoom, event handlers, etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`

### 2. Animation Library Imports ✅
**Problem**: Components were trying to import from `motion/react` which doesn't exist. The `motion` package is for vanilla JS, not React.

**Fix**:
- Changed all motion imports from `motion/react` back to `framer-motion`
- `framer-motion` v12.23.24 is already installed and is the correct React animation library

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/Canvas.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/EntityNode.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/RelationshipNode.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/AttributeNode.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/FloatingToolbar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/StatusBar.tsx`

### 3. Code Cleanup ✅
**Fix**:
- Removed debug console.log statements from App.tsx and Canvas.tsx
- Removed test button and debug info div
- Fixed unused variable warning (index parameter)
- Fixed type error in handleSaveSchema function

## Backend Connection Setup

### Current Configuration
The frontend is configured to connect to the backend:
- **Frontend**: Running on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: Should run on `http://localhost:5000` (FastAPI server)
- **Proxy**: Configured in `vite.config.ts` to forward `/api/*` requests to backend

### Starting the Application

#### 1. Start the Backend (Python FastAPI)
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```

Or if you have Python 3 specifically:
```bash
cd backend
python3 run.py
```

**Note**: If Python is not installed, you need to:
1. Install Python 3.8+ from python.org or Microsoft Store
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (optional, for Gemini AI features)

#### 2. Start the Frontend (React + Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # If not already done
npm run dev
```

The app should open automatically at `http://localhost:5173`

### Testing the Connection

1. **Health Check**: The API should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
2. **API Docs**: FastAPI provides automatic docs at `http://localhost:5000/docs`
3. **In the App**: 
   - Click "Playground" button to load sample diagrams
   - Click "About" (with sparkles icon) to test AI schema generation
   - Add entities manually using the "Work" button or floating toolbar

## Canvas Features Now Working

With the Canvas component properly implemented, you can now:

1. **Add Entities** (Rectangles): Click "+" button in floating toolbar or toolbar
2. **Add Relationships** (Diamonds): Click relationship button in floating toolbar
3. **Drag and Move**: Click and drag entities or relationships to reposition them
4. **Pan Canvas**: Click and drag on empty canvas area to pan view
5. **Zoom**: Use zoom controls in toolbar
6. **Show/Hide Attributes**: Toggle attribute ovals around entities
7. **Auto Layout**: Automatically arrange entities in a circular pattern
8. **Select Elements**: Click to select entities/relationships for editing in right sidebar
9. **Animated Connections**: Beautiful gradient lines connecting relationships to entities with cardinality labels

## Test Data / Playground

The "Playground" button (Beaker icon) in the toolbar opens a modal with 3 pre-built sample diagrams:
- School Database (Students, Courses, Enrollments)
- E-Commerce System (Customers, Products, Orders)
- Hospital Management (Patients, Doctors, Appointments)

Click "Load Diagram" on any sample to populate the canvas immediately.

## What Was Wrong (Technical Details)

1. **App.tsx Line 342**: Had `<div data-canvas className="flex-1">` with manual entity rendering instead of `<Canvas>` component
2. **Motion Imports**: Package `motion` (v10.18.0) doesn't have a `/react` export - it's for vanilla JS DOM animations
3. **Correct Package**: `framer-motion` (v12.23.24) is the React wrapper for Motion One and is what should be used

## Verification

All linting errors have been resolved:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No unused variables
- ✅ Proper imports
- ✅ Type safety maintained

## Next Steps

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed) to run the backend
2. **Start both servers** as described above
3. **Test the canvas** by adding entities and relationships
4. **Test the playground** by loading sample diagrams
5. **Test AI generation** if you have a Gemini API key configured

The Canvas should now render properly, and the test data from the playground modal should load and display entities and relationships correctly!
